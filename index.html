<h1>Astrology, Philosophy and Bitcoin</h1>
<p>On 13 December 2018 I experienced an awakening which has changed my Life. Ever since this event, I kept on feeling a need to dedicate my time into expressing my knowledge in a form as simple as possible so that anyone could understand it. Life is full of Suffering but it is my hope that with what I write here, the reader could integrate fully into his/her individuality and alleviate as much Suffering from this finite world as possible so that we could bring Heaven on Earth.
</p>
<p>I would like to start off by informing the reader that I was strongly Atheist before the year 2018 and it is with the discovery of Bitcoin and the eventual exploration into this rabbit hole that I have come to where I am right now. If the reader has no intention whatsoever to change his/her Life then I would kindly ask the reader to take his/her leave.

<p><b><u>English Gematria</u></b>
</p>
<p>In our modern world, the most convincing way to show that a pattern or logic exists is through mathematics. I will therefore use English Gematria to show an interesting mathematical pattern from the Bible before dwelling into major Philosophical concepts and Bitcoin.
</p>
<p>The gematria sequence that I would like to bring to your attention is the following:

<div style="margin: 0 auto">
<div style="background-color:Gold;margin-left:50px;width:500px">
<p style="font-family:Consolas">ABCDEFGHIJKLM</p>
<p style="font-family:Consolas">1234567654321</p>
<p>NOPQRSTUVWXYZ</p>
<p>1234567654321</p>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Using the above gematria sequence, the following words will have a summation to the following number:
</p>
<div style="margin: 0 auto">
<div style="margin-left:50px">
Creator = 28
Design = 28
Holy Bible = 28
Adam and Eve = 28
Humankind = 28
Freedom = 28
Liberty = 28
</div>
</div>
<div style="margin: 0 auto">
<div style="background-color:lightblue;margin-left:50px;">
<ul>
<p>
28 is also a number for the following:</p>
Number of phalanges on both hands = 28
Number of days it takes Moon to orbit the Earth = 28
Female days cycle = 28
</ul>
</div>
</div>

Let's try another set of words and attempt to make a story out of these patterns:
<div style="margin: 0 auto"><div style="background-color:lightblue";"margin-left:50px"><ul>
God money = 24
Valuable = 24
Earth = 24
24 hours in 1 Day
Day = 7
7 days in a week
Gold = Au = 7
Adam = 7
Man = 1,1,1 = binary 7
</ul>
</div>
</div>
Here is a more advanced version that integrates the Euclid Method and verses from the Bible:
<div style="margin: 0 auto"><div style="background-color:lightblue";"margin-left:50px"><ul>
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 6 5  4  3  2  1 
Jesus + 12 disciples = 13
God = 13
Jesus Christ = 59

Euclid Method -> 13# + 1 = 59 X 509
Assume the left parts of both sides of the equation equal to each other and apply the same to the right side.
13# = 59
God = Jesus Christ
1=509
1=5 X 0 X 9 
1 = 0
Everything = Nothing
John 1:3 - “Through him all things were made; without him nothing was made that has been made”
John 1:3 -> 1:3 -> 13 = God
</ul>
</div>
</div>
