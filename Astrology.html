  <h3>Astrology - Pisces, the opposing fishes</h3>
<p><i>“Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakens”</i> – Carl Jung, Swiss psychiatrist, psychoanalyst and founder of analytical psychological</p>
<p>From this section onwards, the material will require good mental energy and intelligence in order to understand. Please note that these information typically require Masters to PhD level in order to understand however I believe with simple expressions, anyone can easily gain access to this very valuable knowledge.
</p>
<p>As you are very likely aware, there are a total of 12 Zodiacs according to the Astrological signs:</p>
<p>Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces.</p>
<div id="JungAstroClock">
</div>
<p>Notice these 12 Zodiacs are supposed to revolve around the Earth. If we add Earth into the count of 12, then we obtain 13. Again this is alluding to the 13 disciples from the Bible and half the total count of the English Gematria mentioned in the previous section.
</p>
<p>From an Astrological point of view, the Year that the world is in indicates which Zodiac is currently manifesting itself on Earth. The sequence of Zodiac begins from the reverse – it starts with Pisces and ends with Aries.
</p>
<p>One of the greatest psychological and astrological breakthroughs that Carl Jung made was that he discovered extremely vast amounts of similarity between our mind’s understanding of this world/our ancestors’ culture and the Astrological sign Pisces.</p>
</p>
<p>Pisces is symbolized as two opposing fishes – not fully meeting and are in conflict. This could be interpreted as Christ and Anti-Christ. During the early years into AD (Anno Domini), the predominant idea is that of Christ – this symbolizes the first fish. And as we can clearly see in our modern world today, we are at the pinnacle of Anti-Christ – that is the second fish. This is the prime concept for explaining how we are nearing the end or have already ended the age of Pisces. When the year was pointing to the first fish the world was dominated by Christ. And now the year is or was pointing to the second fish and the world is at the pinnacle of Anti-Christ. Now please take a look at the below image of the clock.</p>
</p>
<div id="PiscesClock">
</div>
<p>If the hand on this clock is moving clockwise, then in order for the hand to move from the right fish to the left fish, the Pisces symbol must be placed on the lower side of the clock. If the Pisces symbol is placed on the top side of the clock, then the hand will be moving from left to right. The reason why the hand should be moving from right fish to left fish is because our right brain controls the left part of our body while our left brain controls the right part of body – it has an opposing nature. What we see now is that the left brain which controls the right part of the body seems to be dominating because many of us are right-handed or feel that the right part of our body is the dominant side.
</p>
<p>Let us attempt to fit the pieces together then. It makes sense that the Old Testament was written to describe the age of Aries. Historical references also say that the Old Testament could be written as early as 1400 BC. Each age lasts approximately 2000 years. The stories from the Old Testament were also very gruesome and full of war - which fit the Aries symbolism
</p>
<p>The New Testament began the age of Pisces which symbolizes Christianity. The New Testament was written in the early AD which also coincides with the 2000 year cycle. The idea of sacrifice and Good and Evil and Chinese philosophy of Yin and Yang match the Pisces entirely. Pisces - two fishes facing opposite of each other. Jesus Christ could also be symbolized as the Ram in Aries because Jesus Christ sacrificed himself – that is the last Ram in the age of Aries to be sacrificed.
</p>
<p>We are now at a point where we are approximately 2000 years into the age of Pisces. We are either transitioning into or already are in the age of Aquarius. The advent of the Internet and Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto seems to suggest the arrival of the new age is coming.
</p>
<p>If you are not convinced, let me take you on a journey to the dualistic nature of existence – symbolizing Pisces.
</p>
<p>Our world is separated West and East, North and South, hot and cold, long and short, old and young, Male and Female, and the list goes on. This is the reason why Chinese philosophy has Yin and Yang as one of its central theme. The nature of existence itself has a dualistic element to it – but this will be explored in more detail in the later sections. I am simply bringing this point out to explain that Pisces could be seen everywhere.
</p>
<p>Notice also that the names of many ancient philosophers during BC (Before Christ) are only of one name: Plato, Aristotle, Socrates. When the age ushered into AD (Anno Domini), many people began having two names: Claudio Ptolemy, Thomas Aquinas, and Jesus Christ being the first.
</p>
<p>AD in the English Gematria described in the previous section has a sum of 5. BC also has a sum of 5. The number 55 is resurrection. So it is as if Jesus Christ’s resurrection brought the divide between AD and BC - and resurrected a grand new cycle of Zodiac for humans to live in.
</p>
<p>There are many more references to this dualistic motif and I will update this section as I am reminded about these.
