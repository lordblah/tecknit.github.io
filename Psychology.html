  <h3>Psychology - Analytical</h3>
<p><i>“I don't think that you have any insight whatsoever into your capacity for good until you have some well-developed insight into your capacity for evil”</i> – Jordan Peterson, Canadian Clinical psychologist and professor of psychology</p>
<p>This section could get very long so I will only include the key concepts here. The purpose would be to debunk the false narratives that the mainstream media spews out to the public about identities. This will include gender, racial or other ideologies that the mainstream portrays in order to divide, and then conquer.</p>
<p>To start things off, I would like to get this issue out of the way: Gender. That is because this is the most basic and common sense idea that any human Being could understand, and yet because of the influx of gender ideologies created by the mainstream, the average person is confused about his/her own gender. The short answer is to simply look below to find your sex and therefore your gender. Here is the long answer:</p>
<p>Sex is defined as the biological substrate in which the Gender manifests itself. Gender would be how the person determine whether the Self is Masculine or Feminine. However there is one thing that even the most Masculine Female cannot deny - it is that this Female is a Female psychologically. The same also holds true for Male.</p>
<p>The reason for this is because aside from our genitals being different from the opposite Sex, our brain is also different. Inside our brain there are two almond-shaped substance called the Amygdala - separated into left and right. The left amydala is dominant for Females whereas for Males the right amydala dominates. As you may be aware, the amydala inputs primate emotions onto our mind when the human body feels situation necessitates it. The most common example would be the emotion of fear. This is very useful during human primates times because it allowed humans to understand danger and the need for survival. However as our minds are vastly more sophisticated now, we are expected to keep the amygdala into moderation. Since Male and Female have different dominant amygdala, there are bound to be differences in which Male and Female react to danger.</p>
